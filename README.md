install swww from aur extas/ in order for wallpaper to work
<br>
put pfp in ~/.config/hypr/pfp.png
<br>
and desktop wallpapers are to be put in ~/wallpapers/
<br>
as for the lock screen wallpaper it should be in ~/wallpapers/Wallpaper.jpg
<br>
that, or edit the path in ~/.config/hypr/widgets/sidepanel.py
<br>
also edit the password, its hardcoded in lockscreen.py or something (my bad okay i couldnt get pam to work). If you ever find yourself stuck, the default pass is 1234, or ctrl+w to close the lockscreen. (You should probably change that too, comment out the line that has ctrl+w and keybinding in it (I trust you know how to read)).
